This is located on a 'pedestal' in front of the 40" TV. It consists of the 2 Arcade sticks and 2 lightguns and a wireless keyboard and mouse.

It is connected via the gaming computer via a 4 port USB 2.0 extender over Cat6 cable, with a 10 meter Cat6 cable, so that I can play arcade games on my pedestal without lots of wires.

##### Retro Games Consoles

I have a [Kaico Edition OSSC Open Source Scan Converter 1.6](https://kaicolabs.com/product/kaico-edition-open-source-scan-converter-ossc/), which upscales all my retro consoles to HDMI. I use cables from [https://retrogamingcables.co.uk/](https://retrogamingcables.co.uk/) with the OSSC, which are highly recommended as they make so much difference in terms of audio and video noise. The right cable can also unlock better sound and graphics quality when combined with the OSSC than was ever available before.

I also have a [Marsellie MClassic](https://marseilleinc.com/products/buy-mclassic) HDMI to HDMI hardware-based AI image improver and upscaler which I use for the output of the OSSC.

Currently these are the consoles I have hooked up. They are all 'PAL' unless otherwise specified:

### My PC and Console Games

I collect physical and digital games, both modern and retro. You should able to browse through the games I have, both on PC and console, here: [https://wordswords.github.io/media-library-homepage](https://wordswords.github.io/media-library-homepage)

I also have an install of [ExoDos](https://www.retro-exo.com/exodos.html) and [ExoWin31](https://www.retro-exo.com/win3x.html) on my media PC, which allows me to play any game ever released on DOS and Windows 3.1.

### Living Room TV Setup

We have a separate minimal setup in our living room which my wife uses heavily. It is minimal because she doesn't like overcomplicated tech stuff :) It consists of:

* Sony BRAVIA 2023 Edition, KD-43X75WL, 43 Inch, LED, Smart TV, 4K HDR, Google TV

Because it has Google TV, we can use the Plex app to wirelessly stream 4K videos from my Plex server, and it handles 4K videos well, which is not a small feat as the wireless signal is being blasted through a concrete wall :) Netflix and all the other standard services also work well.
