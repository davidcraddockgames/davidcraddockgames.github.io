Perhaps I am unusual, but I don't get angry generally about new games that I buy. If I don't like them, I don't just play them. I have tons of games that I don't like. For me, it's the same as buying a book. I do not feel 'ripped off' if I do not enjoy the book, I realise that I am paying for the development of the game and the hundreds (often thousands) of man hours that have gone into playing it. I realise that all art is subjective, and everyone has different 'takes' on things - so I don't try and tell other people what they might or might not enjoy, I just report what I enjoy (and I usually only write reviews for games I really like).

I guess part of that is that unlike many, I've actually worked briefly in the gaming industry, and I know how much blood, sweat and tears gets poured into these works. I also have insight into how amazingly difficult it is to make a successful game, from watching many documentaries on indie games and reading many books and articles on game development.

So I have a bit of a different perspective from the majority of gamers who somehow think they are being 'cheated' when they buy a game that they end up not liking.

Regardless of my personal take and perspective, and how much it annoys me to hear gamers constantly being negative about the games, gamers and game developers I love, and the hobby I've loved for 30+ years, I do not logically see why people are still buying games if they mostly do not enjoy them. Even if they like 10 games out of every 100 they buy, they are paying an awful lot of money for a lot of disappointment and negative emotions.
